Mongodb Section:

mongodb v3.2.0 installed in vagrant box used

sudo npm install --save mongoose

above installs 4.11.10, trying again to set to match book version

sudo npm uninstall mongoose

sudo npm install --save mongoose@3.8.20
  npm WARN deprecated mongodb@1.4.12: Please upgrade to 2.2.19 or higher

so revert back to latest, 4.11.10.

sudo npm uninstall mongoose

sudo npm install --save mongoose
  for some reason installed v3.9.7, so forced latest with:
  
sudo npm install --save mongoose@latest

after setting mongoose in code get the following deprecation warning:

`open()` is deprecated in mongoose >= 4.11.0, use `openUri()` instead, or set the `useMongoClient` option if using `connect()` or `createConnection()`. See http://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#use-mongo-client
Mongoose connected to mongodb://localhost/Loc8r

making suggested changes.

changed from connect() to createConnection().
