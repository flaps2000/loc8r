how to push repo to github from host at synched folder, same local repo as already pushed to heroku repo?

or push to multiple remote repositories from guest vm.

post Vagrantfile as a gist for each tutorial repository.

ssh stuff:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

ssh-add ~/.ssh/gitkraken_rsa - change to standard id_rsa?

As of 4.1.1, routes not restful. /location/review/new. new should be view indicator not in url. new set by action post surely?

emulate mobile devices in chrome through javascript console?

Mongodb Section:

mongodb v3.2.0 installed in vagrant box used

sudo npm install --save mongoose

above installs 4.11.10, trying again to set to match book version

sudo npm uninstall mongoose

sudo npm install --save mongoose@3.8.20
  npm WARN deprecated mongodb@1.4.12: Please upgrade to 2.2.19 or higher

so revert back to latest, 4.11.10.

sudo npm uninstall mongoose

sudo npm install --save mongoose
  for some reason installed v3.9.7, so forced latest with:
  
sudo npm install --save mongoose@latest

after setting mongoose in code get the following deprecation warning:

`open()` is deprecated in mongoose >= 4.11.0, use `openUri()` instead, or set the `useMongoClient` option if using `connect()` or `createConnection()`. See http://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#use-mongo-client
Mongoose connected to mongodb://localhost/Loc8r

making suggested changes.

changed from connect() to createConnection().
  now no log? mongod running?
  
Check mongod is running
  service mongod status or 
  status mongod
  
  is running

Make api end point list for testing in a file, api_end_points.txt

Add controllerLocations.locationsList
Add conditional between locationsList and locationsListByDistance

difference from book. distance returned from mmongod for cafe location is now in m, not km.

  how to revert back to previous commit with a new push?
  heroku rollback (remember new version)
    fix (apiOptions.server)
  heroku rollback remembered-version -1

Added port forwarding to Vagrantfile to allow heroku local testing
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5000, host: 4568
  
  couldn't test as would require re-provisioning vm, and could get messy at this stage.
  
Ch 8:

QUIRK: would not load myAPp module in example until added 'var myapp = ' to module definition.
  exactly as book says not to.
  however, if you then remove var prefix it continues to work!
  
QUIRK: had to move angular and loc8r script tags to head in layout to load!!!
  against best practise? and book?

Ch 9:

  Script tag moved to head in layout. will not load at end of file
  added derfer=treu, for better loading
  
  cannot get uglify to work. min file does not load.
  bad idea to generate in express app.js. loops endlessly.
  use grunt or gulp
  
  sudo npm install --global gulp-cli
  
  npm install --save-dev gulp
  
  sudo npm install --save-dev gulp-concat
  
  npm install --save-dev gulp-rename
  
  npm install --save-dev gulp-uglify
  
  NOT WORKING

        works on heroku though!?
        but only if map url is http, if set to https get 403

  should post return anything?
  should register be post, then redirect to get?
  shouldn't login be a get? not post? what are we posting?
